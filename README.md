# 🏨 Hotel Booking Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores hotel booking data using two parallel approaches:

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** for data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Excel Dashboard** for creating an interactive visual interface covering key booking, customer, and revenue insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand booking trends over time (month, year, arrival date).
- Analyze cancellation patterns by market segment, country, and deposit type.
- Identify top-performing distribution channels and market segments.
- Extract customer demographics and behavior patterns.
- Calculate revenue indicators like ADR and total revenue.
- Provide clear KPI cards, slicers, and visuals for a complete dashboard experience.

## 🧩 Tools Used

- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `openpyxl`
- **Excel**: Pivot Tables, Slicers, Pie/Bar/Line Charts, KPIs, Conditional Formatting
